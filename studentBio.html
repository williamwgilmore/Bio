		After synthesising and purifying DNA, quality testing for the medical software company EPIC Systems, and working as an animal care technician for a sustainable food company I've decided to become a web developer. Each job before had a positive effect on the world, but they all left me wating more out of the job. I think that web development will allow me to make a larger impact and stay challenged and motivated on a day to day basis.
